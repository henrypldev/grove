description: Grove configuration files and options.
---

Grove stores its configuration in `~/.config/grove/`.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cli.json` | CLI configuration (port, etc.) |
| `config.json` | Registered repositories |
| `sessions.json` | Active session state |
| `certs/` | Tailscale TLS certificates for ttyd |
| `pid` | PID file for the background server process |

## CLI Configuration

The CLI configuration file at `~/.config/grove/cli.json` stores persistent settings.

```json
{
  "port": 3000
}
```

### Options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | `number` | `3000` | Server port |

The port can also be set per-invocation with the `--port` flag, which takes precedence and updates the saved config.

## Sessions

Active terminal sessions are tracked in `~/.config/grove/sessions.json`. This file is managed automatically — sessions are added when created and removed when cleaned up.

Each session entry contains:

- Session ID
- Repository name and branch
- Working directory
- Terminal URL and port
- ttyd process PID
- The command being run (for `grove run` sessions)

## Environment Variables

You can configure environment variables for each repository through the Mac app or by editing the Grove configuration file directly at `~/.config/grove/repos.json`.

Environment variables are defined per repository:

```json
{
  "repos": [
    {
      "id": "wanssqx5",
      "path": "/Users/henry/Projects/mite",
      "name": "mite",
      "envVars": [
        {
          "key": "CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT",
          "value": "dev:hallowed-armadillo-23",
          "filePath": ".env.local"
        },
        {
          "key": "API_KEY",
          "value": "sk-1234567890"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| `key` | Yes | The environment variable name |
| `value` | Yes | The environment variable value |
| `filePath` | No | Path where the env file will be saved (useful for monorepos). Defaults to `.env.local` at the repository root |

When a worktree is created, Grove generates the environment files with the configured variables.

## Setup Steps

You can configure automatic setup steps that run when a session starts by creating a `.grove/setup.json` file in your repository root.

### Configuration

Create `.grove/setup.json` in your project:

```json
{
  "setup": [
    {
      "name": "Install dependencies",
      "run": "npm install"
    },
    {
      "name": "Build project",
      "run": "npm run build"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `setup` | array | List of setup steps to run in order |
| `setup[].name` | string | Display name shown in the UI |
| `setup[].run` | string | Shell command to execute |

### Behavior

- Steps run sequentially in the worktree directory
- Each step shows real-time status (pending, running, done, failed)
- If a step fails, subsequent steps are skipped
- You can cancel running steps or retry failed ones from the UI
- Output from each step is captured and viewable in the setup inspector

### Example for React Native / Expo

```json
{
  "setup": [
    {
      "name": "Install dependencies",
      "run": "npm install"
    },
    {
      "name": "Install pods",
      "run": "cd ios && pod install"
    },
    {
      "name": "Build iOS",
      "run": "npx expo run:ios"
    }
  ]
}
```

## TLS Certificates

Grove uses Tailscale certificates for HTTPS terminal access. Certificates are generated automatically using `tailscale cert` and stored in `~/.config/grove/certs/`. They are reused across sessions for the same Tailscale hostname.
