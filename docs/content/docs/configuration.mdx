description: Grove configuration files and options.
---

Grove stores its configuration in `~/.config/grove/`.

## Files

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `cli.json` | CLI configuration (port, etc.) |
| `config.json` | Registered repositories |
| `sessions.json` | Active session state |
| `certs/` | Tailscale TLS certificates for ttyd |
| `pid` | PID file for the background server process |

## CLI Configuration

The CLI configuration file at `~/.config/grove/cli.json` stores persistent settings.

```json
{
  "port": 3000
}
```

### Options

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `port` | `number` | `3000` | Server port |

The port can also be set per-invocation with the `--port` flag, which takes precedence and updates the saved config.

## Sessions

Active terminal sessions are tracked in `~/.config/grove/sessions.json`. This file is managed automatically — sessions are added when created and removed when cleaned up.

Each session entry contains:

- Session ID
- Repository name and branch
- Working directory
- Terminal URL and port
- ttyd process PID
- The command being run (for `grove run` sessions)

## TLS Certificates

Grove uses Tailscale certificates for HTTPS terminal access. Certificates are generated automatically using `tailscale cert` and stored in `~/.config/grove/certs/`. They are reused across sessions for the same Tailscale hostname.
