description: Install Grove and start managing terminal sessions from your phone.
---

Grove is a server and CLI for managing Git repositories and terminal sessions from a mobile device. Run Claude Code sessions on your dev machine, access them from anywhere.

## Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh)
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) with Funnel enabled
- [ttyd](https://github.com/tsl0922/ttyd)
- [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

## Installation

### Homebrew (recommended)

```bash
brew tap henrypldev/grove
brew install grove
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/henrypldev/grove.git
cd grove
bun install
```

### Install dependencies

tmux and ttyd are required for terminal sessions:

```bash
brew install tmux ttyd
```

Tailscale is required for secure remote access:

```bash
brew install --cask tailscale
```

Make sure Tailscale is running and you're logged in before using Grove.

## Quick Start

### Start the server

```bash
grove start
```

This starts the Grove server interactively. It will check that all dependencies are installed, start the HTTP server, and set up a Tailscale Funnel for external access.

### Run a command with mobile access

```bash
grove run claude
```

This launches Claude Code in a tmux session with a ttyd web terminal, accessible over HTTPS via your Tailscale hostname. Open the printed URL on your phone to interact with the session.

## How it works

1. **grove CLI** starts the server and sets up a Tailscale Funnel for external HTTPS access
2. **grove server** exposes a REST API for managing repos, worktrees, and terminal sessions
3. **Terminal sessions** are tmux sessions served via ttyd over HTTPS
4. **Grove mobile app** (separate repo) connects to the server to create and manage sessions
